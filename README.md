This is a small script that generates a
50MB HFS file containing files from
content/

It is mostly copied from the makefile of
https://github.com/thamugadi/powerpc-ofw-boot

and contains Haiku's bootinfo.txt file

Please be careful when using the script. I
don't take any responibility for data loss
that might occur because of this.
